## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- d5cd4d1: Updated dependencies

## 1.6.0

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Fixes https://github.com/mathematic-inc/ts-japi/issues/23

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3dc7c4c: Allow null for empty to-one relationships

## [1.3.0] - 2020-06-23

### Added

- Added an `isErrorDocument` function to detect JSON:API Error documents. This function allows you
  to treat the argument _as if it were an error document_ (there is obviously no way to know if it
  really is a JSON:API error document at runtime).
- Added an `isLikeJapiError` function to detect JSON:API Error. This function allows you to treat
  the argument _as if it were an JSON:API error_ (there is obviously no way to know if it really is
  a JSON:API error at runtime).

### Changed

- Exported a `isPlainObject` and `isObjectObject` functions from internal.

## [1.2.7] - 2020-06-22

- Fix for #10
- Fix for #11

## [1.2.6] - 2020-06-19

### Changed

- Changed user-level repo to org-level repo.
  - Links have been fixed in docs and README

## [1.2.5] - 2020-06-19

### Changed

- Exported interfaces related to JSON:API.
  - The Error and Data document interfaces now require the "errors" and "data" properties
    respectively.
  - The Base document interface has been abstracted further by removing the "meta" property.
  - A _new_ Meta document interface is now available for type-checking.

## [1.2.4] - 2020-06-19

### Changed

- Smaller packaging

## [1.2.3] - 2020-06-06

### Changed

- Updated license to Apache 2.0
- Fixed some grammatical errors in README

## [1.2.2] - 2020-05-27

### Added

- A new `Cache` class is now available to use for caching. You can set this in the `cache` option
  for a `Serializer` (use `true` if you want the built in cache).
- With caching, there is a ~586% speed improvement (412,768 ops/sec over the previous 70,435
  ops/sec). Without-caching rates have stayed the same.

## [1.2.1] - 2020-05-27

### Added

- More keywords to `package.json` to help user search for this package.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-05-26

So, `ts-japi` has only been released a few days, but after some significant use in my APIs, I have
realized a few things:

1. Linkers and certain classes should be allowed to parse `nullish` data (`nullish` meaning
   `undefined` or `null`).
2. The `relationships object` should be allowed to have custom keys, not dependent on the `relators`
   options
   - `Relator`s should always have a `Serializer`; otherwise, they wouldn't relate to any `resource`
     per se.
3. Projections should be "choose included" or "choose excluded" similar to MongoDB's.
4. The code can be faster.

With this in mind, here are the changes.

### Changed

- **[Breaking Change]** Every relator must define a `Serializer` as the second argument in its
  constructor (as opposed to the relator's options. Options can go in the third argument.
  - It may be subtle, but the reason for this lies in the fact `relationships object` must be keyed
    by the related object. If the relator has no serializer, then the relator has no related name,
    hence there is no canonical way to key the relationship.
  - We will now allow objects of relators to be defined as an option for `relators` on
    `Serializer`s. By using objects, the key for the relationship generated by the relator will
    correspond to the same key for that of the relator's.
- Several functional options now allow for `nullish` (`null` or `undefined`) arguments:
  - Resource Linkers can now type-safely use `nullish` arguments.
  - Resource Metaizers can now type-safely use `nullish` arguments.
- Several plain options now allow for `nullish` (`null` or `undefined`):
  - Serializer `projection` option has changed significantly (see the option itself) with `nullish`
    values.
- There is a ~33% speed improvement. (70,435 ops/sec over 52,843 ops/sec on a low-end Macbook Pro
  15")

### Added

- Started a CHANGELOG to keep users updated.

#### Important Note

I want to say this IS unusual to have a breaking change without depreciation, but given the fact
this package is only a few days old, I want to apologize if you are bothered by the above break.
However, I will guarantee that API changes will go through depreciation before removal, so happy
coding :)
