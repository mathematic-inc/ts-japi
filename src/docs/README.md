## Features

- This is the **only** typescript-compatible library that fully types the JSON:API specification and
  performs _proper_ serialization.
- [**Zero dependencies**](#zdg).
- This is the **only** library with [resource recursion](#wirr).
- The modular framework laid out here _highly promotes_ the specifications intentions:
  - Using links is no longer obfuscated.
  - Meta can truly be placed anywhere with possible dependencies laid out visibly.
- This library is designed to adhere to the specifications "never remove, only add" policy, so we
  will remain backwards-compatible.

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://mathematic-inc.github.io/ts-japi) has everything that is covered here
and more.

## Installation

You can install ts-japi in your project's directory as usual:

```bash
npm install ts-japi
```

## Getting Started

There are fives classes that are used to serialize data (only one of which is necessarily required).

- {@link Serializer} with {@link SerializerOptions}
- {@link Relator} with {@link RelatorOptions}
- {@link Linker} with {@link LinkerOptions}
- {@link Metaizer}
- {@link Paginator}
- {@link ErrorSerializer} with {@link ErrorSerializerOptions}
- **NEW** {@link Cache} with {@link CacheOptions}

You can check the [documentation](https://mathematic-inc.github.io/ts-japi) for a deeper insight
into the usage.

### Examples

You can check the [examples](https://github.com/mathematic-inc/ts-japi/tree/master/examples) and the
[test](https://github.com/mathematic-inc/ts-japi/tree/master/test) folders to see some examples
(such as the ones below). You can check
[this example](https://github.com/mathematic-inc/ts-japi/blob/master/examples/full.example.ts) to
see almost every option of {@link Serializer} exhausted.

## Serialization

The {@link Serializer} class is the only class required for basic serialization.

The following example constructs the most basic {@link Serializer}: (Note the `await`)

```typescript
[[include:serializer.example.ts]]
```

### Links

The {@link Linker} class is used to generate a normalized
[document link](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links). Its methods are not meant to be called.
See the [FAQ](#faq) for reasons.

The following example constructs a {@link Linker} for `User`s and `Article`s:

```typescript
[[include:linker.example.ts]]
```

#### Pagination

The {@link Paginator} class is used to generate
[pagination links](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination). Its methods are not meant to be
called.

The following example constructs a {@link Paginator}:

```typescript
[[include:paginator.example.ts]]
```

### Relationships

The {@link Relator} class is used to generate top-level
[included data](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-top-level) as well as resource-level
[relationships](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships). Its methods are
not meant to be called.

{@link Relator}s may also take optional {@link Linker}s (using the {@link RelatorOptions.linkers |
linker} option) to define
[relationship links](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships) and
[related resource links](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-related-resource-links).

The following example constructs a {@link Relator} for `User`s and `Article`s:

```typescript
[[include:relator.example.ts]]
```

### Metadata

The {@link Metaizer} class is used to construct generate metadata given some dependencies. There are
several locations {@link Metaizer} can be used:

- {@link ErrorSerializerOptions.metaizers}
- {@link RelatorOptions.metaizer}
- {@link SerializerOptions.metaizers}
- {@link LinkerOptions.metaizer}

Like {@link Linker}, its methods are not meant to be called.

The following example constructs a {@link Metaizer}:

```typescript
[[include:metaizer.example.ts]]
```

### Serializing Errors

The {@link ErrorSerializer} class is used to serialize any object considered an error (the {@link
ErrorSerializerOptions.attributes | attributes} option allows you to choose what attributes to use
during serialization). _Alternatively_ (**recommended**), you can construct custom errors by
extending the {@link JapiError} class and use those for all server-to-client errors.

The
[error serializer test](https://github.com/mathematic-inc/ts-japi/tree/master/test/error-serializer.test.ts)
includes an example of the alternative solution.

The following example constructs the most basic {@link ErrorSerializer}: (Note the lack of `await`)

```typescript
[[include:error-serializer.example.ts]]
```

### Caching

The {@link Cache} class can be placed in a {@link Serializer}'s {@link SerializerOptions.cache |
cache} option. Alternatively, setting that option to `true` will provide a default {@link Cache}.

The default {@link Cache} uses the basic
[`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is)
function to determine if input data are the same. If you want to adjust this, instantiate a new
{@link Cache} with a {@link CacheOptions.resolver | resolver}.

## Deserialization

We stress the following: Given that there are many clients readily built to consume JSON:API
endpoints (see [here](https://jsonapi.org/implementations/)), we do not provide deserialization. In
particular, since unmarshalling data is strongly related to the code it will be used in (e.g.
React), tighter integration is recommended over an unnecessary abstraction.

## Remarks

There are several model classes used inside TS:JAPI such as `Resource` and `Relationships`. These
models are used for normalization as well as traversing a JSON:API document. If you plan to fork
this repo, you can extend these models and reimplement them to create your own custom (non-standard,
extended) serializer.

## FAQ

> Why not just allow optional functions that return the internal `Link` Class (or just a URI
> `string`)?

The `Link` class is defined to be as general as possible in case of changes in the specification. In
particular, the implementation of metadata and the types in our library rely on the generality of
the `Link` class. Relying on user arguments will generate a lot of overhead for both us and users
whenever the specs change.

> Why does the `Meta` class exist if it is essentially just a plain object?

In case the specification is updated to change the meta objects in some functional way.

> What is "resource recursion"?<a id="wirr"></a>

Due to [compound documents](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-compound-documents), it is possible
to recurse through related resources via their
[resource linkages](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-linkage) and obtain
[included resources](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-top-level) beyond primary data relations.
This is should be done with caution (see {@link SerializerOptions.depth} and
[this example](https://github.com/mathematic-inc/ts-japi/blob/master/examples/resource-recursion.example.ts))

## For Developers

To get started in developing this library, run `npm install`, `npm run build` and `npm test` (in this
precise order) to assure everything is in working order.
